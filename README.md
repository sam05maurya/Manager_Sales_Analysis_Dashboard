# Manager Sales Data Dashboard

## Introduction

The Manager Sales Data Dashboard is an interactive visualization tool designed to track and evaluate sales performance across different regional managers, product categories, and time periods.
It consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Total Profit, Target Achievement Rate, Customer Retention Rate, and New Customer Acquisition into a single, user-friendly interface.

By combining bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and treemaps, the dashboard offers both a high-level overview and detailed breakdowns, enabling stakeholders to monitor business growth, assess sales strategies, and identify performance gaps.

## Problem Statement

In large sales organizations, data related to revenue, profit, customer acquisition, and target achievements is often scattered across multiple reports and spreadsheets.
This creates challenges such as:

* Difficulty in assessing regional and managerial performance in a timely manner
* Lack of clear insights into product category contributions to revenue
* Limited visibility into the effect of discounts on customer acquisition
* Inability to track customer retention trends over time
* Delayed decision-making due to fragmented data sources

The primary objective of this dashboard is to address these issues by providing a centralized, visual, and interactive reporting solution that enables managers and decision-makers to make timely, data-driven sales strategies.
